### Procedure
Hardware Setup â€“ 
1. Connect one wire between the Raspberry Pi's GND (ground) pin and the breadboard's blue line.
2. Examine the two pins on the LED. One is obviously shorter than the other. 
3. Connect the shorter pin to the blue GND line, and the longer to any other connection.
4. Connect one resistor pin to the same line as the longer LED pin, and the other resistor pin to a separate line.
5. Finally, connect one wire between the same line as the other resistor pin and the GPIO number 17 to complete the circuit (more on Raspberry Pi pins and GPIOs). The sixth pin on the GPIO header.
