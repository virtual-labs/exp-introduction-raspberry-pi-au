### Procedure
## What you need?
*Raspberry Pi?
There are several models of Raspberry Pi . Raspberry Pi 4 Model B is the newest, fastest, and easiest to use.
Raspberry Pi 4 comes with 2GB, 4GB, or 8GB of RAM. For most educational purposes and hobbyist projects, and for use as a desktop computer, 2GB is enough.
* A power supply
To connect to a power socket, all Raspberry Pi models have a USB port (the same found on many mobile phones): either USB-C for Raspberry Pi 4, or micro USB for Raspberry Pi 3, 2, and 1.
* A microSD card
Your Raspberry Pi needs an SD card to store all its files and the Raspberry Pi OS operating system.

*A keyboard and a mouse
To start using your Raspberry Pi, you need a USB keyboard and a USB mouse.

Once you’ve set up your Raspberry Pi, you can use a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse, but you’ll need a USB keyboard and mouse for the first setup.
