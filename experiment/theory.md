### Theory

The Raspberry Pi is a small-sized computer that can run a variety of operating systems, including Linux-based distributions. It was originally developed to promote computer science education and to provide an affordable platform for learning and experimentation. The Raspberry Pi Foundation, a non-profit organization, designs and produces these boards.

The latest version, as of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, is the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, which features a powerful quad-core ARM processor, up to 8GB of RAM, various connectivity options (such as USB, Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth), and a range of input/output (I/O) pins for interfacing with external devices. These features make it suitable for both educational purposes and real-world applications.
