Raspberry Pi is the name of a series of single-board computers made by the Raspberry Pi Foundation.
The Raspberry Pi is a very cheap computer that runs Linux, but it also provides a set of GPIO (general purpose input/output) pins, allowing you to control electronic components for physical computing and explore the Internet of Things (IoT).
